# Overview

Alacritty is a terminal emulator, it's main appeal to me is that it's available on all operating systems and it uses a configuration file which allows me to keep things consistent.

# Usage

There's not much to say on this one, it's a terminal. You can update `alacritty.toml` to change the settings. I reccomend the docs for more information on configuration.
